# hello-world
this is the start, a new project for testing github
I like coffee, guitars and tobacco. I have a BBA in Business IT, but am currently on a pension. I want to create a project to edit the omega-rpg game. I have already fixed a bug in it, and have started to translate the English version into Finnish.
